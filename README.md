# Final-Project
Data Analytics Project (Python (Pandas, NumPy Matplotlib, Seaborn))

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Loaded cleaned datasets: Contacts, Calls, Deals, Spend
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns
- Handled missing values, converted data types (e.g., Created Time → datetime)
- Added new time-based features: day of the week, month, hour, etc.

## 📊 Descriptive & Exploratory Analysis
Analyzed distributions by:
- Contact owners (Contact Owner Name)
- Creation time (daily, weekly, hourly patterns)
  
Calculated key statistics: mean, median, mode, range

Explored categorical variables: quality, stage, source

## 📈 Time Series & Funnel Analysis
Visualized time trends:
- Number of created contacts and deals over time
- Call activity and its relationship to deal closure

Built a sales funnel from contact to closed deal

## 📊 Campaign & Channel Effectiveness
Compared marketing campaigns:
- By number of leads
- By conversion rate (CR)

Evaluated lead quality by marketing source (Source)

## 📊 Sales Performance
Assessed individual sales reps:
- Deal volume, revenue, and CR

- Identified top-performing products and education formats

## 🌍 Geographic Analysis
- Created geo maps showing deals by city
- Assessed the impact of German language proficiency on deal success by region

## 📈 Unit Economics & Growth Hypothesis
- Calculated product-level unit economics: AOV, CAC, LTV, CLTV, CM
- Built a business metric tree
- Identified growth points
- Formulated a business hypothesis with a ≤ 2-week A/B testing plan

# Deliverables
